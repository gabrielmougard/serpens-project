# Simulation results

This is the place where we store the simulation results coming from the ROS nodes and the gazebo master node.
These result are used for offline plotting purposes (the plotting functions are in 'notebooks/plotter.ipynb')

Since we can't have a working gazebo client (none of us had a native ubuntu machine to show the simulation in real-time,
we will do it offline with a jupyter notebook server)
